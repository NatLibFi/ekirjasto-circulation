# Library Simplified Server Core
![Build Status](https://github.com/nypl-simplified/server_core/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg?branch=develop)

Default Branch: `develop`

This is the Server Core for [Library Simplified](http://www.librarysimplified.org/). The server core contains functionality common between various LS servers, including database models and essential class constants, OPDS parsers, and certain configuration details.

The [OA Content Server](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/content_server), [Metadata Wrangler](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/metadata-wrangler), and [Circulation Manager](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation) all depend on this codebase. Treat it well.

## Installation & Workflow

Thorough deployment instructions, including essential libraries for Linux systems, can be found [in the Library Simplified wiki](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/Simplified/wiki/Deployment-Instructions). **_If this is your first time installing a Library Simplified repository, please review those instructions._**

More often than not, this repository is installed and altered as part of another server using the following commands:
```sh
$ git submodule init    # from inside one of the
$ git submodule update
$ cd core               # make changes to core, as needed
```

Keep in mind that this workflow requires that any changes to the server core are committed and pushed independent to changes in the parent server.

Should you need to work on the core alone, use a traditional git workflow:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:NYPL/Simplified-server-core.git core
```

## Testing
The github actions CI service runs the unit tests against Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 automatically using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

To run `pytest` unit tests locally, install `tox`.

```
pip install tox
```

Tox has an environment for each python version and an optional `-docker` factor that will automatically use docker to
deploy service containers used for the tests. You can select the environment you would like to test with the tox `-e` 
flag.

### Environments

| Environment | Python Version |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| py36        | Python 3.6     |
| py37        | Python 3.7     | 
| py38        | Python 3.8     | 
| py39        | Python 3.9     |

All of these environments are tested by default when running tox. To test one specific environment you can use the `-e`
flag. 

Test Python 3.8
```
tox -e py38
```

You need to have the Python versions you are testing against installed on your local system. `tox` searches the system for installed Python versions, but does not install new Python versions. If `tox` doesn't find the Python version its looking for it will give an `InterpreterNotFound` errror.

[Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is a useful tool to install multiple Python versions, if you need to install missing Python versions in your system for local testing.

### Docker

If you install `tox-docker` tox will take care of setting up all the service containers necessary to run the unit tests
and pass the correct environment variables to configure the tests to use these services. Using `tox-docker` is not required, but it is the recommended way to run the tests locally, since it runs the tests in the same way they are run on the Github Actions CI server. 

```
pip install tox-docker
``` 

The docker functionality is included in a `docker` factor that can be added to the environment. To run an environment
with a particular factor you add it to the end of the environment. 

Test with Python 3.8 using docker containers for the services.
```
tox -e py38-docker
```

### Local services

If you already have elastic search or postgres running locally, you can run them instead by setting the
following environment variables:

- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE`
- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_ELASTICSEARCH`
- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL`
- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_USER`
- `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_PASSWORD`

Make sure the ports and usernames are updated to reflect the local configuration.
```
# Set environment variables
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE="postgres://simplified_test:test@localhost:9005/simplified_circulation_test"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_ELASTICSEARCH="http://localhost:9006"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_ENDPOINT_URL="http://localhost:9007"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_USER="simplified"
export SIMPLIFIED_TEST_MINIO_PASSWORD="12345678901234567890"

# Run tox
tox -e py38
```

### Override `pytest` arguments

If you wish to pass additional arguments to `pytest` you can do so through `tox`. The default argument passed to `pytest`
is `tests`, however you can override this. Every argument passed after a `--` to the `tox` command line will the passed 
to `pytest`, overriding the default.

Only run the `test_cdn` tests with Python 3.6 using docker.

```
tox -e py36-docker -- tests/test_cdn.py
```
